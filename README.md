# Power Loss Approximations for PyPSA-Eur

Description of the formulations can be found in [this repository](https://git.scc.kit.edu/FN/papers/paper-loss-approximation).

## TODOs

- [ ] extract computation time and memory consumption
- [ ] illustration of feasible space
- [ ] implement `n.lopf(pyomo=False)` variant.
